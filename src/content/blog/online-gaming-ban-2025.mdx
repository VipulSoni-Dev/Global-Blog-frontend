| **Maharashtra**  | ₹3,000+ cr GST + 30k jobs | Hub for MPL, Zupee ops; Mumbai Indians sponsorship at risk |
| **Karnataka**    | 25k+ jobs | Bengaluru was startup HQ for fantasy firms |
| **Delhi NCR**    | ₹2,500 cr ads spend | Dream11’s largest ad footprint; media houses feel heat |
| **Tamil Nadu**   | Previously tried own ban | Already anti-RMG, minimal impact vs peers |
| **Goa & Sikkim** | Casino + poker spillover | Fears offshore/grey operators rise |
| **West Bengal**  | ~₹1,200 cr revenue | Rummy stronghold; cultural impact noted |
