##  Why MacIntyre’s Start Is Special  
- Robert MacIntyre scorched the course with a stunning **8-under 62** in Round 1, capped off with **six straight birdies**, believed to be the first such streak in the current playoff format. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- He followed up with a **64 in Round 2**, extending his lead to **five shots**—the largest 36-hole lead since Jason Day in 2015. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Analysts attribute his surge to a mid-season putting overhaul that’s paying dividends. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
