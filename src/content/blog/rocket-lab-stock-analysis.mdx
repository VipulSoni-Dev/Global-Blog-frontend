## 3. What U.S. Investors Want from RKLB

| Investor Focus | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Execution on Neutron** | Determines long-term competitiveness vs. SpaceX & ULA. |
| **Contract Wins** | Regular government contracts = stable revenue base. |
| **Profitability Roadmap** | Moving from R&D heavy losses to free cash flow positive. |

## 4. Outlook

Analysts remain split:  
- **Bullish View:** RKLB could trade above $15 again if Neutron succeeds and contracts scale.  
- **Bearish View:** Execution risks and funding dilution may keep shares in the single digits.  

For U.S. investors, Rocket Lab is **not just a stock but a bet on the commercialization of space**. Unlike speculative peers, it has proven launch cadence, but the next few years will test whether it can scale sustainably.
